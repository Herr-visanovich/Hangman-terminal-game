# Hangman-terminal-game
An Hangman game to play on the terminal.

By running HangMan.java, this Java program implements the classic HangMan game, where one player thinks of a word, and another player attempts to guess the word letter by letter.
The game requires player 1 to write the word and then the program outputs a certain number of lines, avoiding player 2 to read the original word.
As incorrect guesses accumulate, the number of lives decrements by 1 (default value is 4). 
The goal is for the guessing player to decipher the hidden word before the lives counter reaches 0.
 
Since this is a program developed for practicing my skills and preparing for an exam, and i wanted to practice with array of reference type, 
the word is encrypted as an array of Strings each of length 1, initially set to be all "-".
